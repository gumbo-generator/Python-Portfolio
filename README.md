# Python

Hello!

This is portfolio containing a number of basic Python programs I have personally developed.

Some programs were learned from helpful tutorials and various documentation; other programs were conceptualised from original ideas and familiar methodologies adapted from other languages. 

Also, I understand that many of the programs here can be adapted and improved upon in myriad ways, but here I seek to keep the examples simple and concise (for everyone's benefit) as I exhibit my journey as an entry-level developer.

-----------

I would prefer instead to draw your attention towards my use of structure, flow, syntax and commentation - and whether or not you think my approach is readable and applicable across large-scale projects also intrigues me.

As a developer, I am always seeking advice on new ways to accelerate and improve the design / implementation phases of a project, so any feedback and criticism would be greatly appreciated. 

------------

Going foward, I hope the projects showcase some aptitude for software development :)

All the best,
J.
